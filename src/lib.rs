//! A crate that allows using indexes to efficiently query for components
//! by their values in the game engine Bevy.
//!
//! To use indexes, include the [`Index`][crate::index::Index]
//! [`SystemParam`](bevy::ecs::system::SystemParam) as an argument to your systems.
//! [`Index`][crate::index::Index] is generic over [`IndexInfo`][crate::index::IndexInfo], which is
//! a trait that you must implement on your own types to define the behavior of the index.
